# GitHub Data Analysis Portfolio

## Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub Data Analysis Portfolio! I am excited to showcase my skills and expertise as a data analyst. This portfolio contains a variety of data analysis projects that demonstrate my ability to work with data, extract insights, and communicate findings effectively. Each project includes a detailed README with explanations, code, visualizations, and conclusions.
